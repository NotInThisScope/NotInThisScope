- 👋 Hi, I’m @NotInThisScope
- 👀 I’m interested in Video Game Programming (Playstation, Xbox, PC) & Blockchain technology.
- 🌱 I currently program in C++. It's one of the first programming languages that I've learned. I'm also familiar with, to a particular degree, with web programming (HTML, CSS & 
Javascript).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++ programming projects that will allow me to grow and effiecmtly hone my programming skills by coding with other programmers who are much
more advanced than I am.
- 📫 I can be simply be reached by messaging me via GitHub message.

Thank you!
